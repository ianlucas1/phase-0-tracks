2) You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?

  SELECT * FROM reviews, businesses, users WHERE reviews.business_id = businesses.id AND reviews.user_id = users.id;
  
  1|4.7|So peaceful|1|2|1|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|2|Mandy|Kaling

  6|4.5|Surprisingly fresh|6|6|6|Sushi World|6|Meryl|Streepman

3) There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.

  SELECT users.first_name, users.last_name, businesses.name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment FROM reviews, businesses, users WHERE reviews.business_id = businesses.id AND reviews.user_id = users.id;

4) How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business?

  SELECT users.first_name, users.last_name, businesses.name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment FROM reviews, businesses, users WHERE reviews.business_id = businesses.id AND reviews.user_id = users.id AND businesses.name = "Sushi World";
