      1.  What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?<br><br>

         To enable a browser to interpret the meaning/purpose of a portion of HTML code.<br><br>

      2.  What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?<br><br>

          Top to bottom and left to right.<br><br>

      3.  What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?<br><br>

          I learned that there are some shortcuts that I can pre-program to save repetitive typing and I definitely intend to create and use snippets in the future.<br><br>

      4.  What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?<br><br>

          I am still hazy on the need for nuanced semantic tags, but I am sure experience and exposure to future html projects will help make this more clear!
