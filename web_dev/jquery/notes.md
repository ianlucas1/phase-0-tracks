There is a little irony in the guidance for this challenge.  I'd been itching to try a codecademy tutorial as a supplement to the DBC curriculum, and I had already decided to do the one for jQuery before I began this challenge.  So, even though you suggested not to use codecademy, I had my heart set on it.  Plus, I felt frustrated after challenge 9.2, where the Javascript portion felt like a Frankenstein creation that I didn't really understand.  I wanted to have a clearer understanding on the jQuery code that I was about to write and I thought a coherent tutorial would enable that -- which turns out to have been the case.

I didn't become a jQuery neurosurgeon, but I did put more than 2 hours into the tutorial, and I found regular breaks to be critical to staving off entropy.

I also put a little more than 45 minutes into the code writing, but not an excessive amount of time.

Overall, it was a very satisfying experience that opened up my eyes to some new possibilities.
